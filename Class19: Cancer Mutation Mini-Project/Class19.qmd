> Q1. Use blast online or within R...

```{r}
library(bio3d)
df <- read.fasta("A16490010_mutant_seq.fa")
df
```


> Q2. What are the tumor specific mutations.
Use the bio3d package and read my sequence pair into R

```{r}
library(Biostrings)
df$id
df$ali[1, ]
```

Score residue conservation and find the unconserved positions...
```{r}
mutInds <- which(conserv(df) != 1.0)
```

```{r}
df$ali[, mutInds]
```

```{r}
paste( df$ali[1, mutInds], mutInds, df$ali[2, mutInds])
```


> Q3. Do your mutations cluster to any particular domain and if so give the name and PFAM id of this domain? Alternately note whether your protein is single domain and provide itâ€™s PFAM id/accession and name (e.g. PF00613 and PI3Ka).

  My mutations cluster in the PF01056.21 domain. My protein has three domains in total: PF01056.21, PF02344.18, and PF00010.29.
