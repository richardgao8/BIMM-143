Read this file into R and determine the sample size for each genotype and their corresponding median expression levels for each of these genotypes.
```{r}
data <- read.table("ExpressionResults.txt")
head(data)

summary(data)

# Determines sample size for each genotype
table(data$geno)

# Corresponding median expression levels for each genotype
median(data$exp[data$geno == "A/A"])
median(data$exp[data$geno == "A/G"])
median(data$exp[data$geno == "G/G"])

```

Generate a boxplot with a box per genotype, what could you infer from the relative expression value between A/A and G/G displayed in this plot? Does the SNP effect the expression of ORMDL3?

```{r}
library(ggplot2)

ggplot(data, aes(geno, exp, fill=geno)) +
    geom_boxplot(notch = TRUE)

```
