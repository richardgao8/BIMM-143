# The PDB database

Here we examine the size and composition of the main database of biomolecular structures - the PDB.

Get a CSV file from the PDB database and read it into R.

```{r}
pdbstats <- read.csv("pdb_stats.csv", row.names=1)
head(pdbstats)
```


> Q1: What percentage of structures in the PDB are solved by X-Ray and Electron Microscopy.

My pdbstats data frame has numbers with commas in them. This may cause us problems. Let's see:

```{r}
pdbstats$X.ray
```

```{r}
as.numeric(pdbstats$X.ray)
```


```{r}
x <- "22,200"
as.numeric(x) + 1
```

We found a function called `gsub()` now we can figure out how it works.

```{r}
x <- "22,200"
as.numeric(gsub(",", "", x))
```

I can turn this snipet into a function that I can use for every column in the table.

```{r}
commasum <- function(x) {
  sum(as.numeric(gsub(",", "", x)))
}

commasum(pdbstats$X.ray)
```

Apply across all columns.

```{r}
totals <- apply(pdbstats, 2, commasum)
totals
View(totals)
```

```{r}
round(totals / totals["Total"] * 100, 2)
```

> Q2: What proportion of structures in the PDB are protein?

```{r}
totalPro <- commasum(pdbstats[1,7])
totalPro

round(totalPro / totals["Total"] * 100, 2)
```



> Q3: Type HIV in the PDB website search box on the home page and determine how many HIV-1 protease structures are in the current PDB?

```{r}
(215684/249751891 * 100)
```


# 2. Visualizing Protein Structure

We will learn the basics of Mol* (mol-star) homepage:
https://molstar.org/viewer/

> Q4: Water molecules normally have 3 atoms. Why do we see just one atom per water molecule in this structure?

Hydrogen atoms are too small for the scale.

> Q5: There is a critical “conserved” water molecule in the binding site. Can you identify this water molecule? What residue number does this water molecule have

H308

> Q6: Generate and save a figure clearly showing the two distinct chains of HIV-protease along with the ligand. You might also consider showing the catalytic residues ASP 25 in each chain and the critical water (we recommend “Ball & Stick” for these side-chains). Add this figure to your Quarto document.


We will play with PDB code 1HSG

![HIV](1HSG.png)

Show the ASP 25 amino acids:

![HIV-Pr with a bound inhibitor showing the two important ASP 25 amino acids](1HSG-d.png)

Show the ASP 25 amino acids with the stabilizing water molecule:

![HIV-Pr with a bound inhibitor showing the two important ASP 25 amino acids and water](1HSG-d-water.png)

> Discussion Topic: Can you think of a way in which indinavir, or even larger ligands and substrates, could enter the binding site?

If the enzyme's active site can open up at the regions in contact with the water molecule (the flaps) in order for the substrate to access the active ASPs.

## Back to R and working with PDB structures

Predict the dynamics (flexibility) of an imporant protein:

```{r}
library(bio3d)

hiv <- read.pdb("1hsg")
hiv
```

> Q7: How many amino acid residues are there in this pdb object? 

198

> Q8: Name one of the two non-protein residues? 

HOH

> Q9: How many protein chains are in this structure?

2

```{r}
head(hiv$atom)
```

```{r}
pdbseq(hiv)
```

Here we will do a Normal Mode Analysis (NMA) to predict functional motions of a kinase protein.

```{r}
adk <- read.pdb("6s36")
adk
```

```{r}
modes <- nma(adk)
plot(modes)
```

Make a "move" called a trajectory of the predicted motion:

```{r}
mktrj(modes, file = "adk_m7.pdb")
```
