## Importing candy data

```{r}
candy_file <- "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fivethirtyeight/data/master/candy-power-ranking/candy-data.csv"

candy = read.csv(candy_file, row.names = 1)
head(candy)
```

> Q1. How many different candy types are in this dataset?

```{r}
ncol(candy)
```


> Q2. How many fruity candy types are in the dataset?

```{r}
sum(candy$fruity)
```

```{r}
sum(candy$chocolate)
```

## Data Exploration

> Q3. What is your favorite candy in the dataset and what is it's win-percent value

```{r}
candy["Sour Patch Kids",]$winpercent
```

> Q4. What is the winpercent value for “Kit Kat”?

```{r}
candy["Kit Kat",]$winpercent
```

> Q5. What is the winpercent value for “Tootsie Roll Snack Bars”?

```{r}
candy["Tootsie Roll Snack Bars",]$winpercent
```

> Q What is the least liked candy in the dataset - lowest winpercent

```{r}
x <- c(5, 3, 4, 1)
sort(x)
```

```{r}
# orders the indexes to carry out sort function
order(x)
```

```{r}
inds <- order(candy$winpercent)
# sorted by winpercent
head(candy[inds,])
```


```{r}
# install.packages("skimr")
library("skimr")
skim(candy)
```

> Q6. Is there any variable/column that looks to be on a different scale to the majority of the other columns in the dataset?

Yes, row 12 (winpercent) is on a scale of 0 to 100 while the other rows are on a scale of 0 to 1 or are either only 0 or 1.

> Q7. What do you think a zero and one represent for the candy$chocolate column?

Zero represents false and one represents true.

> Q8. Plot a histogram of winpercent values

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(candy, aes(winpercent)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 5)
# or
hist(candy$winpercent, breaks = 20)
```

> Q9. Is the distribution of winpercent values symmetrical?

No, it is slightly right-skewed.

> Q10. Is the center of the distribution above or below 50%?

Below:
```{r}
median(candy$winpercent)
```

> Q11. On average is chocolate candy higher or lower ranked than fruit candy?

First, find all the chocolate candy and their winpercent values

Next, summarize these values into one number

Then do the same for fruit candy and compare their numbers

```{r}
mean(candy$winpercent[as.logical(candy$chocolate)])
mean(candy$winpercent[as.logical(candy$fruity)])
```

Or
```{r}
choc.inds <- as.logical(candy$chocolate)
choc.win <- candy[choc.inds,]$winpercent
mean(choc.win)

fruit.inds <- as.logical(candy$fruity)
fruit.win <- candy[fruit.inds,]$winpercent
mean(fruit.win)
```


> Q12. Is this difference statistically significant?

```{r}
t.test(candy$winpercent[as.logical(candy$chocolate)], candy$winpercent[as.logical(candy$fruity)])
```
Yes this is statistically significant since the p-value is < 0.05

## Overall Candy Rankings

> Q13. What are the five least liked candy types in this set?

```{r}
head(candy[inds,])
```
Nik L Nip, Boston Baked Beans, Chiclets, Super Bubble, Jawbusters

> Q14. What are the top 5 all time favorite candy types out of this set?

```{r}
tail(candy[inds,])
```
Snickers, Kit Kat, Twix, Reese's Miniatures, Reese's Peanut Butter cup

> Q15. Make a first barplot of candy ranking based on winpercent values.

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(candy) +
  aes(winpercent, rownames(candy)) + 
  geom_col()
```

> Q16. This is quite ugly, use the reorder() function to get the bars sorted by winpercent?

```{r}
my_cols=rep("black", nrow(candy))
my_cols[as.logical(candy$chocolate)] = "chocolate"
my_cols[as.logical(candy$bar)] = "brown"
my_cols[as.logical(candy$fruity)] = "red"

ggplot(candy) +
  aes(winpercent, reorder(rownames(candy), winpercent)) + 
  geom_col(fill = my_cols) +
  labs(x="Win Percent", y=NULL) 

  ggsave('barplot1.png', width=7, height=10)
```

You can insert any image using this markdown syntax:

> Q17. What is the worst ranked chocolate candy?

Sixlets

> Q18. What is the best ranked fruity candy?

Starbursts

# Taking a look at pricepercent

```{r}
candy$pricepercent
```

```{r}
ggplot(candy) + 
  aes(winpercent, pricepercent, label = rownames(candy)) +
  geom_point(col = my_cols) +
  geom_text()
```

To avoid overplotting of all these labels we can use an add on package called ggrepel

```{r}
# install.packages("ggrepel")
library(ggrepel)
ggplot(candy) + 
  aes(winpercent, pricepercent, label = rownames(candy)) +
  geom_point(col = my_cols) +
  geom_text_repel()
```

Play with the max.overlaps parameter to geom_text_repel()
```{r}
ggplot(candy) + 
  aes(winpercent, pricepercent, label = rownames(candy)) +
  geom_point(col = my_cols) +
  geom_text_repel(max.overlaps = 8, col = my_cols)
```

> Q19. Which candy type is the highest ranked in terms of winpercent for the least money - i.e. offers the most bang for your buck?

Based off the plot, Reese's miniatures

> Q20. What are the top 5 most expensive candy types in the dataset and of these which is the least popular?

```{r}
tail(candy[order(candy$pricepercent),])
```
Nestle Smarties, Nik L Nip, Ring pop, Mr Good Bar, Hershey's Special Dark - the least popular is Nik L Nip.




```{r}
# install.packages("corrplot")
library(corrplot)
cij <- cor(candy)
corrplot(cij)
```

> Q22. Examining this plot what two variables are anti-correlated (i.e. have minus values)?

Chocolate and Fruity.

> Q23. Similarly, what two variables are most positively correlated?

Chocolate and winpercent.


# On to PCA

The main function for this is called `prcomp()` and here we know we need to scale our data with the `scale=TRUE` argument.

```{r}
pca <- prcomp(candy, scale = TRUE)
summary(pca)
```

```{r}
# Make a new data frame with our PCA results and candy data
my_data <- cbind(candy, pca$x[, 1:3])
```

```{r}
p <- ggplot(my_data) +
  aes(PC1, PC2, 
      size = winpercent/100, 
      text=rownames(my_data), 
      label = rownames(my_data)) +
  geom_point(col = my_cols)

p
```

```{r}
library(ggrepel)

p + geom_text_repel(size=3.3, col=my_cols, max.overlaps = 7)  + 
  theme(legend.position = "none") +
  labs(title="Halloween Candy PCA Space",
       subtitle="Colored by type: chocolate bar (dark brown), chocolate other (light brown), fruity (red), other (black)",
       caption="Data from 538")
```


## loadings plot
```{r}
loadings <- as.data.frame(pca$rotation)

ggplot(loadings) +
  aes(PC1, reorder(rownames(loadings), PC1)) +
  geom_col()
```

> Q24. What original variables are picked up strongly by PC1 in the positive direction? Do these make sense to you?

Fruity, pluribus, hard - this does make sense because it lines up with the correlation matrix earlier and fruity candy tends to come in packages with many hard pieces.
